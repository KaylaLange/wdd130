            <p>Hello! My name is Kayla Lange and I currently live near Estes Park, Colorado. I enjoy adventuring in the mountains with my husband and four kids, eating yummy food, reading, playing board games, and doing yoga. Some of our favorite things to do in the mountains as a family are hiking, swimming in our local river and lake, kayaking, geocaching, and studying the local wildlife and vegetation. I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints when I was 18 years old and have cherished every moment as I've grown closer to my Savior. I have a passion for design and have studied both Interior Design and Graphic Design in the past. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree from BYU-Idaho in Professional Studies where I hope to gain the necessary knowledge and skills required to start my career as a UX designer.</p>

            <p>Colorado is located in the western United States and is a well known Mountain State. Denver, the capital city of Colorado, is the largest city in Colorado and is known as the "Mile High" city due to its high elevation. Colorado is bordered by Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Utah. It boasts beautiful mountain landscapes, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. Colorado is home to a plethora of wildlife, including elk, moose, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, black bears, among many others.</p>
